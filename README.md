Project Overview:
The Bitwise Utility Tool is a menu-driven C program that allows users to perform different bitwise operations on two integers. 
The project is designed to help understand how low-level operations work in C using bitwise operators.This project is suitable for students, beginners in C programming, and for academic submissions.
Why This Project Was Created:
.To understand the working of bitwise operators in C.
.To practice menu-driven programs.
.To improve logic building and control structures. 
.To learn how to take user input and display results repeatedly.
Operations Provided:
.The tool supports the following bitwise operations: AND (&)OR (1)XOR (^) Left Shift (<<)Right Shift (>>) The program keeps running until the user chooses to exit.
Utility of the Project:
.Helps in understanding binary-level operations Useful for students studying C programming, Operating Systems, or Embedded Systems Demonstrates real-time use of bitwise operators.
.Can be extended into a calculator or system utility.
Future Scope:
Add more bitwise operations like NOT (~) Display binary representation of numbersConvert this program into a GUI-based applicationAdd input validation and error handlingExtend for file-based input/output.
